# My Prework Study Guide
## Description

I started this journey with the goal to make a living while not hurting my body from manual labor jobs after my time in the service. I built this project because coding has always been something that has caught my attention so I wanted to get serious about it, I believe I can make a career out of this. The great thing about coding and computers is they dont just slove a singular problem, they are the answers to a majority of our issues to date! I've learened so much its almost imossible to note it all, from being able to use HTML to learing the deep wonders of JavaScript, I cant wait for classes to start!

## Usage
This prework study is rough raft of the things I learned in this preowkr portion. Lots of beginner tips for those wanting to scratch the surface of web development! With HTML and CSS im excided to continue my knowledge of them both, but JavaScript really took the cake for me. Cant wait to learn about its details.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
